<p><strong>Dr. Milton K Benjamin Skill Sets</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a phsicist, mathematician, analyst,  scientist, computer scientist, data scientist, avionics engineer, software  framework developer, structural engineer, department manager.  I can employ dozens of computer programming languages  (c, c++, c#, python, ruby on rails, etc.) and software frameworks (Javascript,  angular html, python, django, etc.).  I  am also a department manager doing all hiring, firing and promotions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I develop complex, multi-faceted models </strong><br>
  <strong>1) based on first principles, </strong><br>
  <strong>2) data science,</strong><br>
  <strong>3) a combination of 1) and 2).  This approach usually yields bore reliable  models.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have received prestigious awards for  my analytical and computer science (money and time saving) software frameworks  I have developed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We also have colleagues in India and the  Philippines who can help with low-cost system development.<u></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>My references will swear by me.</u></strong></p>

<p>Lead Member of Engineering Staff<br>
  Systems/Software Engineering<br>
  Aegis  Systems and Software Engineer<br>
  Structured CMS-2 design/development  including ULTRA-32 assembly language.<br>
  Experience developing software with CMS-2Y/CMS2-L for an AN/UYK-43.and UYK-20. Windows,  Solaris, and UNIX environments.<br>
  MS Office and Integrated Development Environments (IDE) such as ClearCase,  Eclipse and NetBeans.<br>
  VAX operating environment and DCL (Dec Command Language).<br>
  Aegis Tactical Executive System (ATES)  – Aegis AN/UYK-43 operating system.<br>

  System Building - (SYSBLD) – Aegis AN/UYK-43 computer program linker.<br>
  Mercury (data recording and analysis tool).<br>
  <strong>Products Developed: (While an AEGIS C&amp;D  Engineer)</strong><br>
  A program that verifies that FILE,  FUNCTION, and CLASS commenting standards are met by the developers.  SAN II supports multiple programming languages  in the same or in multiple files. Adding another language involves adding code  that supports only differences between what is already there and the new  language.<br>
  <strong>Source Metrics Tool: (SMT)</strong><br>
  A system that counts <u>S</u>ource <u>L</u>ines <u>o</u>f <u>C</u>ode (SLOCS) in multiple programing languages.  New languages are added by writing an SMT script  (META description) of how SLOCs are to be counted in a programming language.  Currently more than 25 distinct programming languages are supported, and others  are being added monthly.<br>
  <strong>Retargeter</strong><br>
  A Framework for developing AEGIS  software in a non-MTASS/CMS2 environment.   This Framework included CMS-2 to C/C++ and/or Ada compilers.  The user can step through the CMS2 code in  the Gnu debugger (gdb) on a UNIX workstation, and inspect values of variables.  The underlying language is C/C++, but the  developer sees only CMS2 in the debugger window.<br>
  This 86,000-line tool also can instrument the resulting C++/C program with  additional lines of code.  These  additional lines of code perform one or more of the following functions:  test coverage, cross profiling for the UNISYS  UYK series of computers. While running on an UNIX Workstation, checking  consistency of engineering units and dimensions as the CMS-2 executes, the  retargeter  is used extensively across  all of AEGIS to capture CMS-2 as C/C++, and has saved AEGIS at least $100,000,000  and possibly as much as $900,000,000 over the last number of years.  Tor this toolset I received the Prestigious AEGIS  excekkece awart in 1995.<br>
  <strong>The UYKxx Dump Analyzer</strong><br>
  This system provides multiple ways  to view the information generated during a UYKxx computer memory dump.  The Dump Analyzer was voted best tool in its  class.</p>
