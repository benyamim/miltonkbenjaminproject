    John Mauro, the owner of Mauro & Associates, LLC holds a PhD in health physics from New York University Medical Center (1973), has been a certified health physicist since 1976 (currently emeritus), and has 50 years consulting experience in the private sector.  In 2004, Dr. Mauro was appointed by the governor of New Jersey as a Commissioner of Radiation Protection (CORP), a position he holds to this day.  Dr. Mauro holds U.S. Patent US 10,031,060, which was issued on July 24, 2018, and U.S. Patent 10,247,653, which was issued on April 2, 2019.  These patents are for a continuous real time monitor for airborne particles of depleted uranium (DU) in the respiratory range.

    Dr. Mauro served as a lifelong consultant to the Radiation Studies Section (RSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in matters related to the reconstruction of radiation doses to members of the public living in the vicinity of weapons complex facilities and also the derivation of the contamination levels and radiation exposures that members of the public and first responders might experience from fallout following a nuclear incident involving the detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND) and a radioactive dispersal device (RDD).

    He also served as a consultant to the National Institute of Safety and Health Administration (NIOSH) on matters related to the reconstruction of the radiation doses experienced by weapons complex workers who experienced one or more radiogenic cancers and were seeking compensation under the Energy Employee Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA).

     Dr. Mauro served as a consultant to a private sector client involved in Natural Resources Damages Assessment (NRDA) at Hanford, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge weapons complex facilities.  The work involved collecting data characterizing the radionuclide concentrations in environmental media, deriving the doses to aquatic and terrestrial organisms, and determining the degree to which these organisms have been or are being damaged due to radiation exposures associated with weapons complex operations.
